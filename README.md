# H1B-VISA-PETITION-2011-2016-ANALYSIS
H-1B visa is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. This visa category enables US based employers to hire foreign internationals. To gain H-1B visa, a US employer must offer a job and file petition for with the US immigration department. H1-B VISA Petitions 2011-2016 play a vital role in foreign workers’ eligibility for working in the United States.  Acquiring H-1B visa is not an easy task and very few of the applicants get it every year – 65,000 (Regular Quota) + 20,000 (Masters Quota). International students do tend to apply for this visa status after graduation. While performing analysis for this project, we learned the process of implementing Regression analysis. The domain of this project is currently popular for foreign students and workers which might prove beneficial if we wish to expand this project soon. Hence, we believe that this project is not only challenging, but also will be a great learning for us.
